Considerations for matching the outside curvature of "L.E.D." elements
to the smallest circle that encloses them

Radius of curvature of ellipse at outside: a*a/b 

Radius of curvature of enclosing circle: L/2+b, where L = "ledLen"

a*a/b = L/2+b
2*a*a = L*b+2*b^2
a = sqrt*((L*b+2*b^2)/2)

a and b in main program are calculated from fractional parts of
ledLen (minorFraction and majorFraction), so, rephrasing the
above we get:

a = Mf*L, b = mf*L (note case)

-> Mf*L = sqrt((L*mf*L+2*(mf*L)^2)/2)
-> Mf = sqrt((L*mf*L+2*(mf*L)^2)/2)/L 
  = sqrt((mf+2*mf^2)/2)
  = sqrt(mf*(1+2*mf)/2)
